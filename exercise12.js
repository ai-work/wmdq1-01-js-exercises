// 12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. 
// The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

// declare and define an array of friends
const friends = ['Irfan', 'Shakeel', 'Ramzan'];

// print personalized messages to friends
console.log(`Assalam o alaikum ${friends[0]}! Good morning. How are you today?`);
console.log(`Assalam o alaikum ${friends[1]}! Good morning. How are you today?`);
console.log(`Assalam o alaikum ${friends[2]}! Good morning. How are you today?`);
